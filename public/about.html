<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Preethi Katamreddy(I don't prefer using my surname. Thus I go with Preethi xD). Well, I'm a recent graduate of Information Technology in Btech. I pursued my B tech at MLR Institute of Technology which is in Hyderabad, India.</p>

<p>Coming to my experience, I went through an internship with Virtusa. But it was just a learning phase that lasted for 5 months. The technology I worked on was .NET which is the exact course I'm doing right now :) Might wonder why should someone do the same course again but here's the thing! The phase wasn't as good as i thought it would be.The provided resources weren't enough to complete the lab tasks also the platform had issues which we couldn't resolve. At the end I learnt few concepts which are useful. </p>

<p>So am here to learn this course from the very basics even though i have knowledge on the basic concepts. I belive this course will help me strengthen my skills in web development. Let's see what happens. That's all about me so bye! xD</p>
